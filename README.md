<h1 align="center">Godot Docs Stable</h1>

<p align="center">Makes sure that when you visit a Godot doc page, it goes to the docs of the stable version of Godot.<p>

## **Why**

This extension was made because every time I had to search something related to Godot, the first link on Google would point to the docs of Godot 3.1 which would then prompt a message saying that I need to click here to go to the latest stable version's docs. So instead of always landing on an older version and having to click to go to the newer version, this extension automatically does it if it detects that you are not on the docs that correspond to the latest version of Godot.

## **Installation**

Currently this extension is only available for Firefox but it will be added to the Chrome store soon.

To use this extension in Firefox, you can go [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/godot-docs-stable/) and add it to your Firefox.
